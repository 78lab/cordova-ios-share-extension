Additional support for multiple shared content types added to handle combinations of single image, text, and URL as dictated by source application and actual content.

This is only a generalized snapshot of my app's proprietary share extension.  I'm a product person who created this with zero Swift or native iOS language knowledge, so I make no claims on its quality or efficiency.
